"""The collector's auth seam: one object holding both credentials, asked per source.

**Neither credential dominates, so the collector holds both and picks per call.** This is measured,
not assumed:

* Only a **GitHub App** sees the account's installed-App inventory and its fine-grained PAT grants
  — both answer `404` to any token. The App is its own principal with its own declared permissions.
* Only an **owner-minted PAT** sees a ruleset's `bypass_actors`, because GitHub discloses that list
  solely to a caller with write access to the ruleset, which a read-only App is never given.

An either/or design would therefore condemn every deployment to one permanent blind spot. So a
caller names the credential that answers ITS question best — `auth.token(prefer=PREFER_PAT)` for
the ruleset detail, `auth.app_jwt()` for the App-only inventory — and where the better credential
is absent, `auth.absent_note(prefer=...)` says which one would have shown more, so a gap becomes
an instruction rather than a dead end.

A caller that does not care asks for `auth.token()` and gets whichever is present.
