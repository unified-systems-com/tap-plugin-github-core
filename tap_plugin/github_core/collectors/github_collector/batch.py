"""GRIFT envelope + batch assembly for the github_core collector.

Spec: plugins/github_core/specs/spec-github-core-v0.md
(req-github-core-collector). THREE batches per run, and the boundaries between
them matter because refs are batch-local (Issue# 162):

1. the collection-scope batch, submitted before the walk so the node exists while the run is
   in progress. Its `SCOPES_RUN` edge targets the core `collection_job`, which is a real id
   from another batch entirely, so that endpoint is an `entity_id` while the scope node is a
   ref. The collector reads the scope's ASSIGNED id back off the import result.
2. the GitHub batch (nodes + spine edges), where almost every github_core node is a ref;
3. the enrichment batch (REFERENCES_RESOURCE / FEDERATES_VIA_PROVIDER edges only), whose
   endpoints are real ids READ BACK OFF THE GRID after batch 2 committed — never refs.

Document shape per `tap_grid/schemas/grift-document.schema.json`:
  {metadata: {grift_version}, _reserved: {}, batches: [GriftBatchContainer]}
