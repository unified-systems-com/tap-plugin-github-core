"""Batch-local REFS for github_core nodes, and the UUIDv5 ids edges still keep.

Spec: plugins/github_core/specs/spec-github-core-v0.md
(req-github-core-models-4 Identity). The natural-key table in the spec is the
source of truth for each entity type's identity inputs.

**Node ids are no longer derived here** (Issue# 162 - git-serious / tap-plugin-github-core).
github_core is core's first adopter of assigned identity: every function below that used to
mint a node's UUIDv5 now returns a batch-local :class:`Ref` — a namespaced key STRING the
GRIFT importer resolves against the model's ``NATURAL_KEY`` declaration, finding the live row
if there is one and assigning a fresh UUIDv7 if there is not. The id a node ends up with is
core's to assign; the recipe here only has to name the same source object the same way twice.

The recipes are unchanged: a ref is exactly the string the old ``_id`` hashed, so every
docstring below still describes the identity inputs and the reasoning behind them.

Two things deliberately stay derived:

- **Edge ids.** The importer never substitutes an edge envelope's id (edges are ``KEYLESS``
  and keep their assignment), so :func:`edge_id` remains the plugin's cross-run edge
  idempotency: the same fact re-observed keeps one edge instead of accumulating one per run.
  Its endpoints are hashed through :func:`_endpoint_token`, which reproduces the node id each
  ref used to derive as, so every edge id is UNCHANGED by this adoption and an existing grid
  gains no duplicates. Edge identity under assigned nodes is Issue# 690 - tap.
- **``commit_observation``.** Its recipe keys on the platform HOST, which the model has no
  field for, so its declaration cannot say what the recipe says. It keeps an explicit derived
  id until that is ruled on — see :func:`commit_observation_id`.
