"""Per-type falsifiers for the git-provable and enumerable shapes (github-core#151, phase 3).

A retirement candidate (``tap_grid.candidates``) is a child the grid holds under a parent
whose listing this run read completely and did not name it. Nothing is retired on that
alone: a **falsifier** — one per entity type, declared in ``[falsifiers]`` of
``tap-plugin.toml`` — probes GitHub for each candidate and hands what it found to
``tap_grid.falsifiers.verdict_from_probe``, which derives the verdict. HTTP success is not a
verdict; the identity and the owner are compared, never the status line
(``req-grid-reconcile-falsifier``). Authority stays off: the verdicts are recorded on the
run's lifecycle batch and the reconcile verb (tap#652) is what would act on them.

Which types get one follows the shape table in github-core#14:

- **Shape A, git-provable** — ``github_workflow`` and ``workflow_job``. The workflow is a file
  under ``.github/workflows/`` at HEAD; its removal is a commit. The probe reads the file at
  HEAD (``GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}``) and, when it is there, resolves the
  Actions workflow record behind it (``GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows/{file}``)
  so a file re-created at the same path with a new workflow id reads as REIDENTIFIED rather
  than as the old one. A declared job is falsified at the same granularity: the job key is
  looked for in that file.
- **Shape B, enumerable** — ``github_repository`` and ``github_environment``. ``GET
  /repos/{owner}/{repo}`` and ``GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/environments/{name}``: 404 is
  ``not_found``, 401/403 is ``forbidden`` (GitHub answers 404 for a private repository the
  credential may not see, so a repository ``not_found`` still means "gone from this
  credential's view", which is all the listing ever claimed), and a found object is compared
  by its stable numeric id and — for a repository — by its owner login, so a transfer ends
  the ownership edge rather than retiring the repository.
- **Shape C, immutable events** — ``github_actions_run`` and ``github_actions_job`` get NO
  falsifier on purpose: no containment edge reaches them, so they are never candidates, and
  a run does not stop having happened when GitHub ages it out.

``Expected.owner`` is the parent's source identity read off the candidate's ``parent``
(Option A, tap#650): the account login for a repository, the repository full name for a
workflow or an environment, the workflow id for a declared job. Where the grid holds no
parent, the owner is ``None`` and the probe's owner is not compared — a comparison the grid
never asked for cannot yield a transfer.

**A 404 is judged against the credential's reach, never taken at face value** (github-core#157,
ruling D on github-core#155). GitHub answers 404 both for an object that is gone and for one
this credential may not see, so ``not_found`` is only allowed to become
``DROPPED_FROM_OBSERVATION`` when the object's repository is provably inside the reach
``tap_plugin.github_core.reach`` resolved for this run. Outside it, or where the reach could not
be read at all, the verdict is ``UNDETERMINED(scope_unknown)`` — a credential that could not
prove it could look never reads as gone. For an object INSIDE a repository the tie-breaker is one
probe of that repository, cached per run: parent answers → the child's absence is the child's;
parent 404 → the child says nothing.

Every probe is a single-object read of the source under this plugin's own credential
(``github_core:collector``, resolved here, never taken from the run context); no response
body is recorded — ``Probe.detail`` carries an HTTP status or an error class only.
