"""Collection scope — what THIS run's credential was allowed to weigh in on.

One node per collection run, on the operation side (`github.observation: execution`), carrying
the fact every downstream absence decision reads before it trusts a missing item: which
repositories the credential could reach, which credential kinds it held, which installation the
App token was minted for, and the account's plan. George ruled it a node rather than a field on
the run (2026-09-14): an App's grants can be narrowed in a settings page and nothing tells the
collector, so the reach is perceived-true-at-a-time like a runner execution. Putting it on the
operation side makes it immutable history and answers "when did we stop being able to see X"
for free.

The node is emitted at the top of the run, before anything is weighed in on, and is later
PATCHED through the service layer — once per tier by reliability 1b's Confirm, and by the
visibility assessment (github-core#15). Both write into seams declared and described here but
left EMPTY by the collector: `tiers` and `visibility`. A run that dies mid-way legitimately
leaves the earlier tiers' verdicts on it.

This node is not the run. Scope facts never go on `collection_job`.
