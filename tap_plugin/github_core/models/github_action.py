"""GitHub Action — a reusable step a declared job pulls in with `uses:`.

The one node in a repository's CI that its owner does not write. A `uses:` line hands a
job's token, its checkout and its secrets-in-scope to code that lives in someone else's
repository at whatever commit a name resolves to on the day the run happens. Every
tag-repoint compromise in the incident corpus is that sentence, so what a job pins and
HOW it pins is the fact this node and its edge exist to hold.

Vocabulary corpus (`specs/spec-github-core-vocabulary.md`): `github_action`, self tier,
four sources, one of which carries `is_pinned` independently of us. No Octicon exists —
GitHub retired `github-action` — so the glyph is TAP-drawn (see `static/.../NOTICE`).

    """An action, keyed on the path a `uses:` line names.

    One node per action PATH, shared across every repository and job that uses it — the
    same fan-in shape as `github_app`. `actions/cache` and `actions/cache/restore` are
    different nodes because they are different `action.yml` files with different
    behaviour. The ref a job pins it at is not part of the node: it is a property of the
    job's `USES_ACTION` edge, because the same action is pinned differently by different
    jobs and the pin is the security-relevant fact about the RELATIONSHIP.
