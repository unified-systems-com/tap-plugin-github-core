"""Rule suite — one push evaluated against a repository's rulesets.

The counterpart to `github_ruleset`, and the answer to a question that node cannot reach.
A ruleset records **who may bypass** it, which GitHub returns only to a caller with write
access to the ruleset. A rule suite records **who did** — and that surface answers a
read-only App installation token with names.

An occurrence, not a change. The vocabulary corpus rejects "change / snapshot /
audit-event types" because the grid already carries field-level history, and that ruling
governs changes to objects we collect ("this ruleset moved to `evaluate`"). A rule suite
is an event in the world we observed, in the same category as `github_actions_run`: it
has GitHub-assigned identity, a timestamp, and facts that point at it.

    """A push evaluated against the rulesets that matched its ref.

    **Only bypasses are collected** (`req-github-core-rule-suites-4`). A passing suite is a
    routine push — roughly 47 a day on one active repository — and landing every one would
    swamp the grid for no finding. `result` is kept as a field so the model can widen to
    `fail` or `pass` without a migration.

    **The actor is an account, and that is all we know.** GitHub gives a login and a numeric
    id. Whether it is a person, a bot or a machine account is not stated, and this model does
    not guess — `PUSHED_BY` points at a `github_account`, the user-or-organization primitive.
