"""The DCOM observation layer is a positive fact on both sides.

Spec: plugins/github_core/specs/spec-github-core-v0.md
(req-github-core-dimensions-4, -5, -6)

The property under test is not "runs are executions" — that was already true.
It is that the *config* layer is stated rather than implied, so a query for it
reads `observation = "declaration"` and never `NOT observation = "execution"`.
An object that declares no layer is a defect these tests are here to catch.
