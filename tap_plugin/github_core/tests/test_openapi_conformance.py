"""The collection manifest conforms to GitHub's published OpenAPI description.

**The gap this closes.** We do not use a GitHub client library that the vendor keeps
current — `api_client.py` is ours, and the manifest's endpoint paths and field names are
hand-authored. So a renamed field or a retired endpoint does not break a build; it
arrives as a collection that quietly returns less. That is the failure this plugin keeps
meeting from other directions: an absence that renders as a finished answer.

GitHub publishes a machine-readable description of its REST API. These tests hold the
manifest against a pinned extract of it (`github_openapi_extract.json`, refreshed
deliberately by `scripts/refresh_openapi_extract.py`), so drift on GitHub's side becomes
a reviewable diff instead of a silent narrowing.

**Offline and hermetic.** The extract is committed; nothing here touches the network. The
refresh is a maintainer's act whose output rides a PR — a ledger, not auto-generation.

Both halves of the transport are covered. GraphQL first looked like the un-checkable one —
a REST description cannot describe it — but **GraphQL describes itself**: introspection is
part of the specification, so the schema is machine-readable by construction, and the four
config-layer sources stop being a blind spot.

**What this cannot check**, stated so the green is not over-read:
- Permissions. GitHub's description carries **no** structured permission metadata: zero of
  its ~1,222 operations declare one, and the prose that exists describes classic scopes
  rather than the fine-grained triples this plugin derives an App manifest from. Those
  triples are authored here and have no upstream to conform to.
